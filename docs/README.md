# HNNP Documentation

This directory is for human-readable documentation, design notes, and implementation guidance for the Human Near-Network Protocol (HNNP) v2.

All behavior across backend, receivers, mobile apps, and SDKs MUST strictly follow the canonical v2 protocol specification in:

- `../protocol/spec.md`

Key docs:

- `integration-guide.md` — high-level “How to integrate” guide covering the 15-second token model, BLE behavior, receiver duplicate suppression, Cloud anti-replay, and onboarding/linking flows.
