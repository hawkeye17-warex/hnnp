For all documentation under `docs/`:

- Use clear, concise Markdown.
- Treat `protocol/spec.md` as canonical; do not redefine or contradict it.
- You may paraphrase and explain the spec, but MUST NOT change field names, wire formats, or cryptographic formulas.
- Prefer sectioned headings and short paragraphs so engineers can quickly scan and implement from the docs.
