# HNNP Device App (Workspace)

This workspace hosts shared device-side logic for HNNP-compatible mobile apps (token generation, BLE advertising helpers, etc.).

At this stage it is a placeholder package; mobile platform implementations live under:

- `mobile/android/`
- `mobile/ios/`

All future logic here MUST strictly follow `protocol/spec.md`.
